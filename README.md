# Comprehensive Daily Planner app

## Pitch

A **daily productivity dashboard** that integrates the cornerstones of health and wellness: **Sleep, nutrition and exercise**. There are many calendar, to-do and sleep tracking apps, but few if any that take a holistic approach. Why fracture our already declining attention spans with multiple apps when we can plan and organize our day in one place.

## MVP

* Account registration and login
* Users are greeted with the time of day and their name
* Display a randomly generated inspirational quote
* Users can input their daily tasks or goals
* Users can input their own motivation for the day (can be a quote, what they're grateful for, or long-term goal they're striving toward)
* Hourly schedule form
    * Allow users to input category of activity
* Meal prep form
* Daily workout form
* Sleep tracking form -- hours slept, average HR/HRV, and space to journal what may have contributed to the sleep quality from prior day
* Visualize the day by category of activity
* Save all data in a database for future retrieval and review


## Potential Future Features

* Implement an API from major sleep trackers (Oura, Fitbit, etc.) to replace manual input of sleep data.
    * Visualize the data to find potential correlations between sleep, food and exercise.
* Implement a _review journal_ that aggregates the daily activity data for users to reflect on and derive lessons learned to be carried on to the next day.
